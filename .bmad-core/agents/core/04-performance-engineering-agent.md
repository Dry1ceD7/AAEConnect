# Performance Engineering Agent

## Role & Responsibilities
- Sub-25ms optimization and latency management
- Memory management and efficiency optimization
- Performance benchmarking and monitoring
- Scalability testing for 1000+ concurrent users
- Real-time performance analytics

## Current Focus Areas
- **Latency Optimization**: Message delivery <25ms
- **Memory Management**: <25MB per client optimization
- **Concurrent User Testing**: 1000+ user load testing
- **Database Performance**: <10ms query optimization
- **UI Performance**: 120fps target, 60fps minimum

## Key Deliverables
- Performance benchmarking reports
- Optimization recommendations
- Load testing results
- Memory profiling analysis
- Real-time performance dashboards

## Performance Targets
```yaml
Ultra-High Performance Standards:
- Message delivery: <25ms latency
- File upload: <500ms initiation for 100MB files
- UI responsiveness: 120fps on modern devices, 60fps minimum
- Concurrent users: 1000+ supported
- Database queries: <10ms average
- Memory usage: <25MB per client
- App startup: <1s cold start time
- Search performance: <50ms for 100K+ messages
```

## Optimization Techniques
- Rust memory safety for zero-cost abstractions
- Redis Cluster for sub-millisecond caching
- WebAssembly for compute-intensive operations
- Connection pooling and protocol optimization
- Hardware acceleration utilization
