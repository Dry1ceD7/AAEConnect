- Native system integrations
- Desktop performance optimizations
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Desktop security implementations

## Technology Stack
```rust
// Tauri Desktop Implementation
[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "1.5", features = ["api-all"] }
tauri-build = { version = "1.5", features = [] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
sqlx = { version = "0.7", features = ["runtime-tokio-rustls", "postgres"] }

// Core Features:
- Native window management
- System tray integration
- Auto-updater implementation
- Native file system access
- Hardware acceleration utilization
```

## Performance Targets
