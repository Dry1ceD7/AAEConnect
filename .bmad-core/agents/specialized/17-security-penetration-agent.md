## Security Testing Framework
```rust
// Security Testing Implementation
use tokio::time::{interval, Duration};
use reqwest::Client;
use serde_json::Value;

// Security Testing Tools:
- OWASP ZAP for automated security scanning
- Nmap for network security assessment
- Burp Suite for web application testing
- Metasploit for penetration testing
- Custom Rust security testing tools
```
